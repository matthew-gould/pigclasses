# Weekend-Homework-1

# This was my third or 4th iteration of this homework. I kept restarting trying to tackle
# it differently but failing each time to get it to work completely. I have most of it
# working at one point but, of course, broke the code at some point and couldn't figure out
# how to fix it. 

# I had the logic down and knew what I wanted the code to do. I just couldn't figure out
# how to feed all the variables I created in all the different functions into the right
# places. I really need to do less complicated functions and code.
